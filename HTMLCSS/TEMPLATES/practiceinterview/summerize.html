<!-- fundamental -->
The section covers CSS positioning properties, z-index, attribute selectors, display properties, CSS units,
pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements, visibility, specificity, and nth-child selectors.

CSS positioning properties include relative, absolute, fixed, and sticky, each with unique behaviors for positioning
elements relative to their parent or viewport.
The z-index property determines the stack order of overlapping elements, with higher values appearing above lower ones.
Attribute and element selectors in CSS allow for flexible styling beyond id or class selectors, such as targeting
specific input types.
Display properties dictate element behavior in the layout, with inline elements flowing with text, block elements taking
up full width, and inline-block elements combining both behaviors.
CSS units define element sizes, with px being fixed, em and rem being relative units, and % used for proportional
sizing.
Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements target specific element states and parts, while visibility and display properties
control element visibility and layout space. Specificity resolves conflicts between multiple CSS rules.
<!-- intermediate -->

Flexbox and CSS Grid are layout models for arranging items in containers, with Flexbox for one-dimensional and Grid for
two-dimensional layouts. Media queries enable responsive design, while properties like box-sizing, overflow, and
clip-path control element dimensions and visibility. CSS animations and sticky positioning enhance UI effects.
<!-- advanced -->

The document discusses various CSS optimization techniques, including preprocessors like SASS and LESS, native CSS
variables, and critical CSS for performance. It also covers the use of mixins, the contain property, and methods like
minification and lazy loading to enhance maintainability and performance. Additionally, it explains CSS transitions and
animations for dynamic styling.

<!-- scenario based -->
The document describes CSS techniques for centering elements, creating responsive layouts with Grid, ensuring sticky
footers, and using vendor prefixes for cross-browser consistency. Key properties and code examples are provided.


<!-- debugging -->
Debugging CSS involves using browser dev tools to inspect and modify styles in real-time, while structuring CSS with
methodologies like BEM enhances maintainability. Inline styles are quick for small changes, but external stylesheets are
better for scalability. Reducing frequent DOM updates improves performance, and semantic HTML enhances accessibility.
