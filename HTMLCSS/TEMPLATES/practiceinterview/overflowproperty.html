<!-- he overflow property in CSS controls what happens when content overflows the boundaries of its container. It is
particularly useful for managing content that is too large to fit within the container's specified dimensions, such as
long text or large images. There are several values for the overflow property, each affecting the behavior of
overflowing content differently.

Overflow Property Values
visible (Default)

Description: The overflowed content is visible and is rendered outside the bounds of the container. It does not cause
any clipping or hiding of content.
Use Case: Useful when you want to ensure that the content is fully visible, even if it exceeds the container's size.
However, this might cause layout issues if content overlaps with other elements. -->

<!-- Example: If a box contains a paragraph of text that exceeds the container's width, the content will spill out and remain
visible beyond the container's boundaries.

hidden

Description: The overflowed content is hidden and does not display outside the container. Any content that exceeds the
bounds of the container is clipped and inaccessible.
Use Case: This is useful when you want to restrict the container's size and prevent content from overflowing visually,
such as in fixed-size containers or for creating scrollable areas. -->


<!-- Example: If a container has a fixed height and a paragraph inside it is too long, the content that exceeds the
container's boundaries will not be displayed. -->

<!-- scroll

Description: The container will always show scrollbars (either horizontal, vertical, or both), regardless of whether the
content exceeds the container's size. The scrollbars are visible even if the content fits within the container (i.e., no
overflow).
Use Case: This is useful when you want to ensure that scrollbars are always available for the user to scroll through the
content, even if the content does not overflow. -->

<!-- Example: If the content is smaller than the container, a scrollbar will still be visible, and the user can use it to
scroll the content.

auto

Description: The browser will automatically add scrollbars only if the content overflows the container. If the content
fits within the container, no scrollbars will be shown.
Use Case: This is the most commonly used value for controlling overflow. It gives a dynamic behavior where scrollbars
appear only when necessary. -->

<!-- Example: If a container has a fixed height and the content is too long, scrollbars will appear automatically, allowing
the user to scroll through the content. If the content fits within the container, no scrollbar will be shown.

overflow-x and overflow-y: Controlling Horizontal and Vertical Overflow
You can also control the overflow behavior separately for the horizontal and vertical axes using overflow-x and
overflow-y. This allows for more fine-grained control over how overflow is handled in either direction.

overflow-x: Controls the horizontal overflow (left-to-right).
overflow-y: Controls the vertical overflow (top-to-bottom).
Example: Controlling Overflow Separately -->


<!-- overflow-x: hidden; overflow-y: auto;: Horizontal overflow is hidden, but vertical overflow will show scrollbars if the
content exceeds the container's height.
overflow-x: auto; overflow-y: scroll;: Vertical scrollbars are always visible, and horizontal scrollbars appear when
needed.
Summary of overflow Values
Value Description Use Case
visible Content is visible and can overflow beyond the container's bounds. When you want all content visible, even if it
overflows.
hidden Overflowing content is clipped and not displayed. When you want to hide overflowed content.
scroll Scrollbars are always visible, regardless of whether content overflows. When you always want scrollbars, even for
content that fits.
auto Scrollbars appear only when content overflows. Most commonly used for responsive and flexible layouts.
overflow-x Controls horizontal overflow. To specify how to handle overflow on the horizontal axis.
overflow-y Controls vertical overflow. To specify how to handle overflow on the vertical axis.
When to Use Each Value:
Use visible when you want to allow the content to overflow without restriction, and it's acceptable for the content to
spill outside the container.
Use hidden when you want to hide overflowed content, particularly when the content shouldn't exceed the container's
dimensions.
Use scroll when you want scrollbars to be always visible, ensuring users can scroll through the content even if it's not
overflowing.
Use auto when you want to allow scrollbars to appear only if necessary, giving a clean interface without unnecessary
scrollbars.
Use overflow-x and overflow-y when you need to control overflow behavior in specific directions (horizontal or
vertical). -->
