<!-- CSS Grid and Flexbox are two powerful layout systems in CSS, and while they have some similarities, they are designed to
solve different layout problems. Here's an overview of the differences between them and guidance on when to use each:

CSS Grid:
CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system, meaning it allows you to control both rows and columns simultaneously.

Key Features of CSS Grid:
Two-Dimensional Layout: It can control both rows and columns at the same time.
Grid Containers: You define a grid container using display: grid;, and then you can define rows and columns using
grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns.
Precise Control: You can place items in specific grid areas, and the grid items will automatically flow into the grid
layout.
Flexible Layouts: The grid can be more complex, supporting overlapping items, dynamic placement, and more.
Example: -->


<!-- When to Use CSS Grid:
Two-Dimensional Layouts: When you need to manage both rows and columns at the same time.
Complex Layouts: When you need more control over the overall page layout, such as grid-based designs (e.g., magazine
layouts, complex forms).
Overlapping Content: CSS Grid allows you to position items in specific grid areas, making it easier to handle
overlapping or layered content.
Flexbox:
Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout system, meaning it is primarily designed to lay out items in either a row or a
column, but not both at the same time.

Key Features of Flexbox:
One-Dimensional Layout: It can only manage items in one direction at a timeâ€”either horizontally (row) or vertically
(column).
Flexible Items: Flexbox allows items to grow, shrink, and align within the container using properties like
justify-content, align-items, and flex-grow.
Auto Flow: Items inside a flex container can "wrap" or "stack" depending on available space.
Alignment Control: Flexbox provides powerful alignment capabilities, such as centering content vertically and
horizontally with ease. -->


<!-- When to Use Flexbox:
One-Dimensional Layouts: When you only need to lay out items in a row or a column.
Flexible and Dynamic Layouts: When you want to create flexible, responsive designs where items adjust to available
space.
Simple Alignment: When you need to align or distribute items within a container easily, such as centering elements or
creating navigation bars.
Space Distribution: If you need to space out elements evenly across a row or column, Flexbox excels at distributing
space automatically.
Comparison of CSS Grid and Flexbox:
Feature CSS Grid Flexbox
Layout Type Two-dimensional (rows and columns) One-dimensional (either rows or columns)
Control Precise control over both rows and columns Control over the layout in one direction only (row/column)
Alignment Aligns both rows and columns independently Aligns items along a single axis (either horizontal or vertical)
Use Case Complex layouts, grids, overlapping items, precise placement Simple layouts, flexible and dynamic content,
centering
Flexibility Great for complex layouts and content structure Great for content that needs to dynamically adjust to
available space
Best for Page layouts, grid systems, forms, complex designs Navigation bars, buttons, item lists, and simple component
layouts
When to Use CSS Grid vs. Flexbox:
Use CSS Grid when:

You need a two-dimensional layout (both rows and columns).
You're working on a complex layout where items need to be positioned in specific places, or where items need to span
multiple rows/columns.
You want to create a grid-based design (like magazine-style layouts, photo galleries, or table-like structures).
You need to create overlapping content or control content placement across multiple axes.
Use Flexbox when: -->

<!-- You need a one-dimensional layout (either a row or a column).
You are designing simple layouts that adjust dynamically (such as navigation menus, buttons, or item lists).
You want to align content easily, especially for centering elements vertically and horizontally.
You need to create a flexible container where items will adjust to different screen sizes or dynamic content.
Combining CSS Grid and Flexbox
You can also combine both systems within a single layout, using Flexbox for simpler, one-dimensional components (e.g.,
navigation bars, buttons), and CSS Grid for more complex, two-dimensional structures (e.g., the overall page layout or
large sections). -->

<!-- Conclusion
CSS Grid is best for two-dimensional layouts and complex grid-based designs.
Flexbox is great for one-dimensional layouts and aligning and distributing items within a container.
Choosing between the two depends on the layout requirements of your project, but for many projects, a combination of
both provides the most flexibility and control. -->
