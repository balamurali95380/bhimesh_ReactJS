<!-- Definition: The z-index specifies the stack order of an element. Elements with a higher z-index value appear in front of those with a lower value.

Values:
Auto (default): The element's stack order is the same as its parent.

Number: Positive or negative integers can be used (e.g., z-index: 1;, z-index: -1;).

Inheritance: z-index does not inherit its value by default.

How Does Stacking Context Work?
A stacking context is a "layer" in which elements are stacked and managed independently of other stacking contexts. Understanding stacking contexts is key to using z-index effectively.

How Stacking Contexts Are Created
A new stacking context is formed when an element meets certain criteria, including:

The root element (<html>) always creates the root stacking context.
Any element with a position other than static (relative, absolute, fixed, sticky) and a z-index value other than auto.
Elements with the following properties also create stacking contexts, even if z-index is not specified:
CSS properties like opacity < 1, transform, filter, perspective, clip-path, or mask.
CSS property will-change with a value affecting stacking.


Rules of Stacking Context
Local Context: The z-index of child elements is relative only to their stacking context's parent.

Independent Layers: Each stacking context is independent of others. Child elements cannot "escape" their stacking context, even with a high z-index.

Rendering Order: Within a stacking context, elements are rendered in the following order (from back to front):
Background/border of the element forming the stacking context.

Descendant elements without position or z-index defined.
Positioned elements with a z-index of auto.
Positioned elements with a positive or negative z-index. -->

<!-- Stacking Contexts:
The first <div> creates a stacking context because of position: relative; z-index: 1.
Within this context:
The pink child appears in front (higher z-index).
The yellow child appears behind the parent (lower z-index).
The second <div> (light green) is in a different stacking context and appears behind the light blue parent because its z-index: 0.
Key Points to Remember
Default Behavior: Without z-index, elements are stacked according to the document's source order.
Isolated Contexts: Changes to a child's z-index are confined within its parent stacking context.
Debugging Stacking Issues:
Ensure the correct stacking context is being created. -->
