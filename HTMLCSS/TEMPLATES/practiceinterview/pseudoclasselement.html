<!-- 1. Pseudo-Classes
Definition: A pseudo-class defines a special state of an element.
Purpose: Targets elements based on conditions, user interactions, or structural states that are not directly available through normal classes or selectors.
Syntax: A colon (:) followed by the pseudo-class name (e.g., :hover).
Examples of Pseudo-Classes
User Interaction States:

:hover: Applies styles when the user hovers over an element. -->

button:hover {
background-color: lightblue;
}
<!-- :focus: Applies styles when an element (e.g., input) is focused. -->
input:focus {
border-color: green;
}
<!-- :active: Applies styles when an element is being clicked. -->

a:active {
color: red;
}
<!-- Structural States:

:first-child: Targets the first child of its parent. -->

li:first-child {
font-weight: bold;
}
<!-- :last-child: Targets the last child of its parent. -->

li:last-child {
color: blue;
}
<!-- :nth-child(n): Targets the nth child of its parent (e.g., every 2nd child). -->

tr:nth-child(2n) {
background-color: lightgray;
}
<!-- Input-Related:

:checked: Targets checkboxes or radio buttons that are checked. -->
input[type="checkbox"]:checked {
border-color: red;
}
<!-- :disabled: Targets disabled form elements. -->

button:disabled {
opacity: 0.5;
}
<!-- Miscellaneous:

:not(selector): Targets elements that do not match the selector. -->

div:not(.highlight) {
background-color: gray;
}
<!-- 2. Pseudo-Elements
Definition: A pseudo-element allows you to style specific parts of an element, such as the first line of text or content inserted before/after the element.
Purpose: Targets portions of an element, even if those portions are not explicitly defined in the HTML.
Syntax: Two colons (::) followed by the pseudo-element name (e.g., ::before). (Single colon : is also valid for older browsers.)
Examples of Pseudo-Elements
Content Insertion:

::before: Inserts content before the element's content. -->


h1::before {
content: "ðŸ”¥ ";
}
<!-- Output: A fire emoji appears before all <h1> elements.

::after: Inserts content after the element's content. -->


h1::after {
content: " âš¡";
}
<!-- Output: A lightning emoji appears after all <h1> elements.

Text Styling:

::first-line: Styles the first line of an element. -->


p::first-line {
font-weight: bold;
color: red;
}
<!-- ::first-letter: Styles the first letter of an element. -->


p::first-letter {
font-size: 2em;
color: blue;
}
<!-- Highlighting:

::selection: Styles the part of an element selected by the user. -->

p::selection {
background-color: yellow;
color: black;
}
<!-- Key Differences Between Pseudo-Classes and Pseudo-Elements
Aspect	Pseudo-Class	Pseudo-Element
Purpose	Targets states or conditions of an element	Targets specific parts of an element
Syntax	Single colon :	Double colon :: (modern)
Examples	:hover, :nth-child, :focus	::before, ::after, ::first-letter
State vs. Content	Applies styles based on interaction or state	Applies styles to content or subparts of an element
