<!-- CSS, animations are created using the @keyframes rule, which allows you to define the stages of an animation, specifying
how the element should appear at various points during its lifecycle. These keyframes describe the intermediate steps of
an animation and can be used to create smooth transitions between different styles.

Creating Animations Using @keyframes
Basic Syntax
css
Copy code
@keyframes animation-name {
from {
/* Starting styles */
}
to {
/* Ending styles */
}
}
@keyframes: Defines the animation and its keyframes.
animation-name: A name for the animation, which you can refer to when applying the animation to elements.
from and to: Represent the start (0%) and end (100%) points of the animation. These can also be written as percentages
(0% for the start and 100% for the end).



@keyframes moveRight: Defines an animation called moveRight.
from: The element starts at left: 0.
to: The element moves to left: 100px.
animation: The .box element uses the moveRight animation, which lasts 2 seconds, runs in a linear timing function, and
loops infinitely (infinite).
Using Percentages for More Control
You can specify multiple stages of the animation using percentages (e.g., 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%), allowing for more
complex animations with intermediate steps.



0%: The element starts at its normal position (transform: translateY(0)).
25%: The element moves up by 30px.
50%: It returns to the original position.
75%: The element moves up again but by a smaller amount (15px).
100%: The element returns to its original position.
Animation Properties
Once you define the animation with @keyframes, you use the following properties to control the behavior of the
animation:

animation-name: Specifies the name of the @keyframes animation.
animation-duration: Specifies how long the animation takes to complete one cycle (e.g., 2s for 2 seconds).
animation-timing-function: Defines the speed curve of the animation (e.g., linear, ease, ease-in, ease-out,
cubic-bezier()).
animation-delay: Delays the start of the animation by a specified time (e.g., 1s).
animation-iteration-count: Specifies how many times the animation should run (e.g., infinite for continuous looping or 3
for three iterations).
animation-direction: Defines whether the animation should reverse after each iteration (normal, reverse, alternate,
alternate-reverse).
animation-fill-mode: Defines what styles should be applied to the element before and after the animation is played
(e.g., forwards, backwards).
animation-play-state: Controls whether the animation is running or paused (running, paused).
Example 3: Full Animation Syntax
css
Copy code



In this example:

fadeIn: The animation starts with opacity: 0 and gradually becomes fully visible (opacity: 1).
animation: fadeIn 3s ease-in-out 1s forwards;:
3s: The animation duration is 3 seconds.
ease-in-out: The timing function makes the animation slow at both the beginning and the end.
1s: A delay of 1 second before the animation starts.
forwards: The element will retain the final state (opacity: 1) after the animation finishes.
Shorthand Syntax for Animation
You can combine all animation properties into one shorthand property:

animation: [name] [duration] [timing-function] [delay] [iteration-count] [direction] [fill-mode] [play-state]; -->



<!-- Summary of Key Animation Properties:
Property Description
animation-name The name of the keyframes animation.
animation-duration Duration of the animation (e.g., 2s, 500ms).
animation-timing-function Defines the speed curve (e.g., linear, ease-in, ease-out).
animation-delay Time before the animation starts (e.g., 1s).
animation-iteration-count Number of times the animation should run (e.g., infinite, 3).
animation-direction Defines the direction of the animation (e.g., normal, reverse, alternate).
animation-fill-mode Defines what happens before/after the animation plays (e.g., forwards).
animation-play-state Controls whether the animation is running or paused (e.g., paused).
Conclusion:
CSS animations with @keyframes provide powerful tools to create dynamic effects on elements. By defining keyframes at
different stages (such as 0% and 100%, or any other percentage), and using various properties for timing, duration, and
repetition, you can create smooth, engaging animations on your web pages. -->
