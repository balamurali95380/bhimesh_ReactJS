<!-- 1. Inline Elements
Definition: Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. They flow within the content, alongside other inline elements or text.

Characteristics:

Does not break to a new line (remains "in-line" with text or other inline elements).
Width and height properties cannot be applied (but padding and margin can affect spacing horizontally).
Only occupies the space defined by its content.
Examples of Inline Elements:

<a>, <span>, <strong>, <em>, <b>, <i>, <img> -->



<!-- 2. Block Elements
Definition: Block elements always start on a new line and take up the full width of their container by default.

Characteristics:

Starts on a new line.
Takes up the entire width of its parent container, even if the content inside is smaller.
Width, height, margin, and padding properties can be applied.
Can contain other block-level or inline elements.
Examples of Block Elements:

<div>, <p>, <h1> to <h6>, <ul>, <ol>, <li> -->


<!-- Each element starts on a new line and stretches across the container. -->
<!-- 
3. Inline-Block Elements
Definition: Inline-block elements combine features of both inline and block elements. They flow inline with other elements, but you can set their width, height, margin, and padding.

Characteristics:

Does not start on a new line (remains inline like inline elements).
Width and height properties can be applied (unlike pure inline elements).
Respects box-model properties like margin and padding.
Examples of Inline-Block Elements:

There are no default inline-block elements, but you can set any element to display: inline-block;. -->

<!-- The inline-block element appears inline with the second <span>, but you can set its dimensions.

<!-- Output:
The first <div> (inline) flows inline with text or other inline elements.
The second <div> (block) starts on a new line and spans the entire width of its container.
The third <div> (inline-block) flows inline but allows for width and height to be defined.
When to Use
Inline: For styling parts of text or inline elements (e.g., <span> or <a>).
Block: For structuring content into sections or paragraphs (e.g., <div> or <p>).
Inline-Block: For creating inline elements with dimensions, such as buttons or layout components. -->
