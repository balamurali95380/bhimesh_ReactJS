CSS variables (also known as custom properties) and preprocessor variables (from tools like Sass and Less) both provide ways to store reusable values for your styles, but they have significant differences in functionality, scope, and usage.

CSS Variables
CSS variables are native to CSS and are defined using the -- syntax. They are dynamic and can be manipulated at runtime via JavaScript or inherited within the DOM.

Syntax
css
Copy code
:root {
  --primary-color: #007bff;
  --font-size: 16px;
}

button {
  background-color: var(--primary-color);
  font-size: var(--font-size);
}
Key Features
Dynamic: CSS variables can be updated at runtime using JavaScript.

javascript
Copy code
document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--primary-color', '#ff5733');
Scoped: CSS variables follow the standard CSS cascading rules and can have different values depending on where they are declared.

css
Copy code
:root {
  --primary-color: #007bff;
}

.dark-theme {
  --primary-color: #333;
}

button {
  background-color: var(--primary-color);
}
Inheritance: CSS variables are inherited by child elements unless explicitly overridden.

Browser Support: CSS variables are supported in modern browsers (Edge 15+, Chrome 49+, Firefox 31+, Safari 9+). They may not work in older browsers without polyfills.

Preprocessor Variables
Preprocessor variables are used in CSS preprocessors like Sass and Less. They are defined using a specific syntax (e.g., $ in Sass or @ in Less) and are resolved at compile time, meaning they are replaced with their values when the preprocessor generates the final CSS.

Syntax
Sass:

scss
Copy code
$primary-color: #007bff;
$font-size: 16px;

button {
  background-color: $primary-color;
  font-size: $font-size;
}
Less:

less
Copy code
@primary-color: #007bff;
@font-size: 16px;

button {
  background-color: @primary-color;
  font-size: @font-size;
}
Key Features
Static: Preprocessor variables are replaced with their values during compilation and cannot be changed at runtime.

No Inheritance: Preprocessor variables do not follow CSS cascading or inheritance rules. They are globally available or scoped only within a file/module.

Support for Calculations: Preprocessor variables can be used with functions or operations during compilation.

scss
Copy code
$base-font-size: 16px;
$large-font-size: $base-font-size * 1.5; // 24px
Requires Compilation: Preprocessor variables are resolved during the preprocessing step and do not exist in the final CSS.

No Runtime Access: Unlike CSS variables, you cannot manipulate preprocessor variables via JavaScript.

Differences Between CSS Variables and Preprocessor Variables
Feature	CSS Variables	Preprocessor Variables
Syntax	--variable-name: value;	$variable-name: value; (Sass) or @variable-name: value; (Less)
Scope	Follows CSS cascade and inheritance rules.	Globally scoped or module-scoped.
Dynamic/Static	Dynamic: Can be changed at runtime.	Static: Resolved at compile time.
Runtime Manipulation	Possible via JavaScript.	Not possible.
Browser Support	Requires modern browsers.	Requires a preprocessor (Sass, Less).
File Dependencies	Independent of tools, directly usable.	Requires compilation into CSS.
Inheritance	Yes, inherited by child elements.	No, variables must be explicitly imported.
Functions and Calculations	Limited (calc(), var() functions).	Extensive (custom and built-in functions).
Readability	Visible in the browser (dev tools).	Hidden after compilation.
When to Use CSS Variables
Dynamic Themes: CSS variables are ideal for creating light/dark themes because their values can be changed dynamically.

css
Copy code
:root {
  --background-color: white;
}
.dark-theme {
  --background-color: black;
}
body {
  background-color: var(--background-color);
}
Runtime Updates: If you need to change styles dynamically (e.g., via JavaScript), CSS variables are the way to go.

Cascading Values: When you want values to cascade or be inherited based on the DOM structure.

When to Use Preprocessor Variables
Complex Projects: Use preprocessors when working on large projects that require advanced features like mixins, functions, or nesting.

Static Styles: When your variables don’t need to change at runtime.

Precompiled Features: If you’re already using other preprocessor features like loops, mixins, or file splitting, it makes sense to use preprocessor variables.

Can You Use Both Together?
Yes! Many developers use both CSS variables and preprocessor variables to leverage the strengths of each. For example:

Use preprocessor variables for calculations and compile-time logic.
Use CSS variables for runtime changes and cascading effects.
Example:

scss
Copy code
// Sass variables for calculations
$primary-color: #007bff;
$base-spacing: 8px;

// Compiling into CSS variables
:root {
  --primary-color: #{$primary-color};
  --spacing: #{$base-spacing}px;
}
Output:

css
Copy code
:root {
  --primary-color: #007bff;
  --spacing: 8px;
}
Conclusion
CSS Variables are dynamic, runtime-accessible, and work natively in the browser. They’re best for theming, cascading styles, and runtime manipulation.
Preprocessor Variables are static and resolved during compilation. They’re ideal for managing complex projects with calculations and logic.
Using both effectively allows you to build scalable, maintainable, and performant styles for modern web applications.
