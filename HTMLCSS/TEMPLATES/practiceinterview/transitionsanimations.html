<!-- SS transitions and animations are both used to create visual effects that change an element's appearance over time, but
they differ in their behavior, flexibility, and use cases. Here's a breakdown of the key differences between them:

1. Definition and Purpose
CSS Transitions:

A transition allows you to change an element's style from one state to another smoothly over a specified duration when a
triggering event occurs (like hover, focus, or class change).
Purpose: Typically used for simple effects like hover states, color changes, or smooth changes between two states (e.g.,
expanding a button on hover).
CSS Animations:

An animation allows for more complex and continuous changes in an element’s style, defined by keyframes that describe
multiple stages of the animation over time.
Purpose: Used for more complex, multi-step animations or continuous animations that do not depend on user interaction.
2. Control and Keyframes
CSS Transitions:

Triggering: Transitions are triggered when there is a change in the element’s state (e.g., when hovering or when the
class changes).
Single State Change: Transitions generally occur between two states (initial state and final state). There are no
intermediate steps between them.
No Keyframes: You don’t define stages between start and end states. You simply specify how the property should change
(e.g., color, width) and how long the change takes.
Example: -->
<!-- transition: <property> <duration> <timing-function> <delay>; -->

                        transition: background-color 0.3s ease;
                        }

                        .button:hover {
                        background-color: blue;
                        transition: background-color 3s ease;

<!-- CSS Animations:

Triggering: Animations can run automatically or be triggered by specific events like page load, hover, etc.
Keyframes: Animations are defined using @keyframes, which specify multiple stages of an animation. These stages can
control how the element changes over time, allowing for more complex animations.
Example:

css
Copy code
@keyframes move {
0% {
left: 0;
}
50% {
left: 100px;
}
100% {
left: 0;
}
}

.box {
position: relative;
animation: move 2s infinite;
}
3. Duration and Timing
CSS Transitions:

Duration: Transitions require you to specify how long the change should take (e.g., 0.3s, 500ms).
Timing Functions: You can control the speed of the transition with timing functions like ease, linear, ease-in,
ease-out, or cubic-bezier().
One-time or Infinite: Transitions happen once, when triggered (i.e., hover in, hover out). They don't automatically
loop.
CSS Animations:

Duration: Animations also have a duration, but they can run multiple times (with the animation-iteration-count property)
and can even repeat infinitely.
Timing Functions: Like transitions, animations can use timing functions, but since animations have multiple keyframes,
the timing function can vary at different stages of the animation.
Repetition: Animations can run once, a specified number of times, or infinitely (infinite), and you can control the
direction of the animation (normal, reverse, alternate, etc.).
4. Triggering Events
CSS Transitions:

User-Triggered: Typically triggered by user interaction (hover, focus, etc.), such as when an element’s state changes.
Example: Hovering over a button changes its background color.
CSS Animations:

Automatic or User-Triggered: Animations can be set to run automatically when the page loads or based on a user
interaction (e.g., hover, click, or focus).
Example: An element animating when the page loads or continuously animating as a background effect.
5. Example Use Cases
CSS Transitions:

Simple hover effects (e.g., changing color, enlarging a button).
Changing visibility, background color, or size smoothly when an element enters or leaves the page.
Example: Button hover effect.
css
Copy code
.button {
background-color: red;
transition: background-color 0.3s ease;
}

.button:hover {
background-color: blue;
}
CSS Animations:

Complex animations involving multiple steps or states (e.g., loading spinners, banners).
Continuous animations that need to loop (e.g., moving a background image or a rotating logo).
Example: Loading spinner animation.
css
Copy code
@keyframes rotate {
0% { transform: rotate(0deg); }
100% { transform: rotate(360deg); }
}

.spinner {
animation: rotate 1s linear infinite;
}
6. Summary Comparison
Feature         CSS Transitions                                     CSS Animations
Trigger      User-triggered (e.g., hover, focus, class change)      Can be automatic or user-triggered
Keyframes    Not used (one start and one end state)                 Uses keyframes for multiple intermediate stages
Complexity   Simple, limited to two states                          Complex, can define multiple steps and loops
Duration     Duration and timing function for smooth transitions    Duration, timing functions, and control over iteration
Repetition   Happens once (or with hover in/out) Can loop           infinitely or run a set number of times
Use Case     Simple effects like hover, focus, class changes        Continuous effects, animations with multiple stages, complex
interactions
When to Use Transitions vs. Animations
Use CSS Transitions when you need a simple, quick effect that changes an element between two states (e.g., hover effects
or changes in styles when a class is toggled).
Use CSS Animations when you need more control, multiple steps, or continuous looping animations (e.g., spinning icons,
page loading animations, or complex background effects). -->
