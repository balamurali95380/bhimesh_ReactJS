<!-- What is Flexbox?
Flexbox, or the Flexible Box Layout, is a CSS layout model designed to create flexible and efficient layouts. It simplifies aligning and distributing space among items in a container, even when their size is dynamic or unknown.

Flexbox operates along two axes:

Main Axis: Defined by the flex-direction. Items are laid out along this axis.
Cross Axis: Perpendicular to the main axis.
Key Flexbox Properties
Below are three important properties: justify-content, align-items, and flex-direction.

1. flex-direction
Definition: Defines the direction of the main axis, determining how flex items are placed in the container.
Values:
row (default): Items are placed from left to right (horizontal main axis).
row-reverse: Items are placed from right to left.
column: Items are placed from top to bottom (vertical main axis).
column-reverse: Items are placed from bottom to top. -->


<!-- Visualization:

row: ➡️ Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3
column: ⬇️
Item 1
Item 2
Item 3 -->
<!-- 2. justify-content
Definition: Aligns items along the main axis.
Values:
flex-start (default): Items align at the start of the main axis.
flex-end: Items align at the end of the main axis.
center: Items are centered along the main axis.
space-between: Items are evenly distributed, with the first item at the start and the last item at the end.
space-around: Items are evenly distributed with equal space around them.
space-evenly: Items are evenly distributed with equal space between and around them. -->

<!-- Visualization (Main Axis - Horizontal):

Value	Layout
flex-start	[Item 1][Item 2][Item 3]
flex-end	[Item 1][Item 2][Item 3]
center	[Item 1][Item 2][Item 3]
space-between	[Item 1] [Item 2] [Item 3]
space-around	[Item 1] [Item 2] [Item 3]
space-evenly	[Item 1] [Item 2] [Item 3] -->
<!-- 3. align-items
Definition: Aligns items along the cross axis.
Values:
stretch (default): Items stretch to fill the container along the cross axis.
flex-start: Items align at the start of the cross axis.
flex-end: Items align at the end of the cross axis.
center: Items are centered along the cross axis.
baseline: Items align based on their text baselines. -->

<!-- Visualization (Cross Axis - Vertical):

Value	Layout
flex-start	Items align at the top.
flex-end	Items align at the bottom.
center	Items align in the middle.
stretch	Items stretch to fill the container.
baseline	Items align by their text baselines. -->

<!-- Result:

flex-direction: row: Items are laid out horizontally.
justify-content: space-between: Items are evenly spaced along the main axis.
align-items: center: Items are vertically aligned to the center of the container.
