<!-- Media queries are a feature in CSS that allow you to apply different styles based on the characteristics of the device
(such as its screen size, resolution, or orientation). They are key to creating responsive designs, which adjust the
layout and appearance of a website depending on the device or viewport size.

In simple terms, media queries let you change the style of a webpage depending on the conditions of the display, such
as:

The width or height of the screen.
The orientation of the device (portrait vs. landscape).
The resolution of the display (e.g., high vs. standard resolution).
The device type (e.g., screen, print).
Basic Syntax of a Media Query
A media query consists of a media type (such as screen or print), followed by one or more media features (such as width,
height, orientation, etc.). -->

    <style>

    /* @media media-type and (media-feature) {
        /* CSS rules go here */
        
        
        
        @media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
        /* CSS rules for screens smaller than 600px */
        body {
        background-color: lightblue;
        }
        /* Default styles (applied to all devices) */
body {
font-size: 16px;
}
        }

/* Media query for devices with a maximum width of 768px (e.g., tablets or mobile devices) */
@media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
body {
font-size: 14px;
}
}

/* Media query for devices with a minimum width of 769px (e.g., desktops) */
@media screen and (min-width: 769px) {
body {
font-size: 18px;
}

/* Default styles for small screens (mobile-first) */
.container {
display: flex;
flex-direction: column;
padding: 10px;
}
}

/* For tablets and larger screens (min-width: 768px) */
@media screen and (min-width: 768px) {
.container {
flex-direction: row;
}
}

/* For large screens (min-width: 1200px) */
@media screen and (min-width: 1200px) {

.container {
padding: 20px;
}
}

/* .container {
    width: 100%; Fluid width
    max-width: 1200px; Max width for larger screens
} */

<!-- Common Media Query Features
width / height:

max-width: Styles are applied if the viewport width is less than or equal to the specified value.
min-width: Styles are applied if the viewport width is greater than or equal to the specified value.
max-height: Styles applied based on the height.
min-height: Styles applied based on a minimum height.
orientation:

portrait: For vertical layouts (height > width).
landscape: For horizontal layouts (width > height).
resolution:

Used for targeting high-resolution devices like Retina displays (min-resolution, max-resolution).
Example: Basic Media Queries -->




<!-- Default styles are applied for all devices.
For screens smaller than or equal to 768px, the font size is set to 14px.
For screens larger than 768px, the font size is set to 18px.
Using Media Queries for Responsive Design
The goal of responsive design is to make websites work across a wide range of devices, from mobile phones to large
desktop monitors. Media queries help achieve this by applying different styles for different screen sizes.

Responsive Design Strategy
Mobile-First Design: Start with the base styles for mobile devices and then use min-width queries to adjust for larger
screens.
Desktop-First Design: Start with desktop styles and use max-width to adjust for smaller devices. -->



<!-- Explanation:

Mobile view (default): The .container is displayed with a column layout and small padding.
Tablet view (≥768px): The .container changes to a row layout (side-by-side elements).
Desktop view (≥1200px): Padding is increased to 20px for larger screens.
Examples of Devices and Common Breakpoints
Here are some common breakpoints used in responsive design, based on popular devices:

Device Type Width Range Common Breakpoints
Mobile 320px to 767px @media (max-width: 767px)
Tablet 768px to 1024px @media (min-width: 768px)
Desktop 1025px to 1200px @media (min-width: 1025px)
Large Desktop 1201px and above @media (min-width: 1200px)
Responsive Design with Fluid Layouts
A responsive design doesn't always need media queries to work. You can use fluid layouts with percentages and relative
units (like em, rem, vw, vh) for flexible sizing that adapts to different screen sizes.
 -->


<!-- Conclusion
Media queries are essential for creating responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
By using features like max-width, min-width, and orientation, you can tailor the user experience based on the device.
Start with a mobile-first approach, and then apply media queries for larger devices as needed-->
