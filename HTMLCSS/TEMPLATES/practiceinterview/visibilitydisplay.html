        /* 1. visibility: hidden
Behavior:

The element remains in the document flow and takes up space, but it is not visible to the user.
All dimensions (width, height, padding, margin) are preserved, and the layout remains unaffected.
The element can still be interacted with programmatically (e.g., via JavaScript).
Use Case:

When you want to hide an element visually but keep its space in the layout. 
Use **visibility: hidden** when you need to hide an element temporarily but want to preserve its space in the layout (e.g., tooltips or status messages that will reappear).

*/
        /* p:hover{
            visibility: hidden;
        } */

        /* 2. display: none

The element is completely removed from the document flow.
It does not take up any space in the layout (as if it doesnâ€™t exist).
The element and its children are not accessible (e.g., via keyboard or screen readers).
Use Case:

When you want to completely hide an element and remove it from the layout. 
Use **display: none** when you want to completely hide an element and remove it from the layout (e.g., dropdown menus, modal windows, or conditional rendering).*/
